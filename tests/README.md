# Test Files

This directory contains test record files used by the test suite, located in the `data` subdirectory.

## Data Files

- `MSBNK-test-TST00001.txt` - Basic test record with peaks
- `MSBNK-test-TST00002.txt` - Test record with multiple CH$NAME fields and annotations
- `MSBNK-test-TST00003.txt` - Test record with deprecated flag and annotations

These files are copied from the MassBank-cli-tools test resources and are used to validate that the TypeScript implementation matches the Java validator behavior.
